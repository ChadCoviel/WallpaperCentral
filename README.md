# Wallpaper Central

This program allows you manage a workspace of photos for editing. Right now the only editing option available is to 
crop a photo.

## How to run
Copy the repository to a location of your choice. Make sure that you have the latest Java JDK installed and then run 
MainApp.java file located at /src/wallpapercentral/app/MainApp.java from within this directory. 

## How to use
Once the porgram begins running it will prompt you to choose one or more images with a few different extension options.
Once those images are chosen the workspace will load then you can left click on an image to crop or add more images to
workspace via the File menu. After clicking an image, the image will be displayed for cropping. Use left-click + drag 
and hold to select of the cropped image then click the crop button. Choose a file name with the extension to save the 
image. Click the back button to go back to the main workspace to choose another image to crop.

## Future plans
Allow the user to add text to an image for further customization.
